Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
Cafe class:
    - The constructor: I wanted to simulate a standard cafe building with two floors and a initial number of supplies
    - sellCoffee(): I wanted to simulate the usual cafe process of selling a cup of coffee with a standard number of supplies except the buyer include specifications
House class: 
    - The constructor: A hoouse is typically built without an elevator or dining hall. I didn't want the user to bother these about additional features except they cared about them
    - moveIn(): typically, mutliple residents move in at once and I wanted the House class to reflect this
Library class: 
    - The constructor: I didn't want the user to be burdened with specifying whether or not a new library should have an elevator except it was something they cared about
    - checkOut(): A user may want to check out multiple books from a library simultaneously, and I thought it would be convenient to include this feature
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Office hours were as helpful as always. Writing out my thought process as I read the instructions before trying to write any code is still extremely helpful. Java syntax still feels a bit clunky, and I have to refer to old assignments to remember how to implement certain syntax, but overall I feel much better about coding in Java. 
My advice to future students: Ask questions. Google a lot (stack overflow and geeksForgeeks are always super helpful)
